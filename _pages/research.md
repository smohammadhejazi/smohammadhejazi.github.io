### Building a Recommendation System Including User Specific Recommendation, Similar Items, and Cold Start 
ðŸ“† *Feb 2022 - Feb 2023*   
    
My bachelor thesis which includes the completed system running in Kubernetes and an elaborate paper describing the concepts and architecture of the system. Also, the code was made into a Python library called KabirRec which could be used to easily build a recommendation system from the ground up. Notably, the project was later used as a service in a much more extensive AI-as-a-service framework.
